# Hex Roleplay Public Plugins
Here you can find all of the plugins that I have decided to release to the public, made by Hex. Hopefully you may find these useful!

Feel free to DM me on Discord at Ice Bear#2034 if you have any questions or need help.

# Plugin List
## Local Event
Pretty simple plugin, it adds in a new command /LocalEvent that is the same as the event command but instead of being global it only broadcasts within yelling distance. The colour of this is also yellow, rather than orange.
## Combine Voices
Another not too complex plugin, I gathered up all the missing combine voicelines from the HL2 Beta Leak in the base game I could find and added them to this file, now you can scream at citizens to your hearts contempt! I also included voice lines for Dispatch/Scanners only.
